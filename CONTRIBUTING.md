## Development Philosophy

When developing for Ali, keep these principles in mind:

1. **User Privacy First**: All data should be processed locally by default
2. **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled
3. **Testability**: Code should be easily testable
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Features should fail gracefully when dependencies are missing
5. **Accessibility**: Design for a wide range of users and devices
6. **Personalization**: Support customization and adaptation

Thank you for contributing to Ali!
